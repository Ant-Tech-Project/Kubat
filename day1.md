# Day 1 of Git version control
## Define version control
Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other. The primary goals of version control are to track changes, collaborate efficiently, and facilitate the management of different versions of a project.

## Explain the purpose and features of Git.
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

## Discuss the drawbacks of not using version control.
Software teams that do not use any form of version control often run into problems like not knowing which changes that have been made are available to users or the creation of incompatible changes between two unrelated pieces of work that must then be painstakingly untangled and reworked. 

## Discuss the difference between centralized and distributed version control.
### Centralized Version Control System
In centralized source control, there is a server and a client. The server is the master repository that contains all of the versions of the code. To work on any project, firstly user or client needs to get the code from the master repository or server. So the client communicates with the server and pulls all the code or current version of the code from the server to their local machine. In other terms we can say, you need to take an update from the master repository and then you get the local copy of the code in your system. So once you get the latest version of the code, you start making your own changes in the code and after that, you simply need to commit those changes straight forward into the master repository. Committing a change simply means merging your own code into the master repository or making a new version of the source code. So everything is centralized in this model. 
There will be just one repository and that will contain all the history or version of the code and different branches of the code. So the basic workflow involves in the centralized source control is getting the latest version of the code from a central repository that will contain other people’s code as well, making your own changes in the code, and then committing or merging those changes into the central repository.

### Distributed Version Control System
In distributed version control most of the mechanism or model applies the same as centralized. The only major difference you will find here is, instead of one single repository which is the server, here every single developer or client has their own server and they will have a copy of the entire history or version of the code and all of its branches in their local server or machine. Basically, every client or user can work locally and disconnected which is more convenient than centralized source control and that’s why it is called distributed. 
You don’t need to rely on the central server, you can clone the entire history or copy of the code to your hard drive. So when you start working on a project, you clone the code from the master repository in your own hard drive, then you get the code from your own repository to make changes and after doing changes, you commit your changes to your local repository and at this point, your local repository will have ‘change sets‘ but it is still disconnected with the master repository (master repository will have different ‘sets of changes‘ from each and every individual developer’s repository), so to communicate with it, you issue a request to the master repository and push your local repository code to the master repository. Getting the new change from a repository is called “pulling” and merging your local repository’s ‘set of changes’ is called “pushing“. 
It doesn’t follow the way of communicating or merging the code straight forward to the master repository after making changes. Firstly you commit all the changes in your own server or repository and then the ‘set of changes’ will merge to the master repository.
